Sprites were 32x32
Display was 400x240

This means the display sprite dimensions are 12.5

Lets change it so sprite squares are 16x16

So that would be 25x15

Now lets think of real world scale for things. We should make the tank about the size of a small sherman tank. 

A sherman tank is 5.84 meters long.

So maybe our standard is that each grid space is 5x5 meters.
